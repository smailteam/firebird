# Firebird
First of all:
1. Firebird is being programed by [@Borisd93](https://github.com/Borisd93).
2. This software is only for Debian based GNU/Linux distributions.
3. This will be compatible with the next version of SMail, not the current.
4. If you want to get support, go to the part "[Desarrollo](https://reisub.nsupdate.info/wiki/?page=SMail#h23-9)" on our website.
